# Landing-Page

This is a landing page project to put into practice the knowledge I've acquired so far in the Odin Project curriculum.  

-I have been working on the CSS styles with the flex containers. I encountered some issues finding out a way to control the image in the hero section size without it overflowing. I managed to put a min and max height until I find a best practice solution for this matter.

# fixing errors

I removed the / from the images sources since it is not allowing my github pages to load the images as expected.
